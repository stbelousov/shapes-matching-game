# Description
A desktop game with GUI.

The game consists of 50 rounds. Each round lasts one second. In each round, you have to answer whether the shown image corresponds to the provided description or not. All images are coloured geometric shapes. All variants of shapes and colours used in this game are shown below. Each correct answer gives you +1 to your score, an incorrect one gives -1 and if you skip the question, your score wouldn't change. You can pause the game and open the menu by pressing ESC at any time.

The implementation is based on the Qt widget toolkit and requires the following Linux packages: qtmultimedia5-dev, libboost-random-dev. A few screenshots are provided in the "examples" folder.
